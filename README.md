Have you ever been hungry for your evening meal but had difficulty choosing what food to eat? This application will solve this problem for users. The app allows users to maintain a list of their favourite meals, and then will make “random” suggestions to the user of which meal they should eat.

## Main Features:

 - Ability to add, edit, delete favourite meals from a list
 - Meals could be home-made dishes or store-bought
 - For each meal the user must specify a name, and may optionally add a
   restaurant name, specify how much time is required for this meal, and
   specify how costly this meal is.
 - At meal times the user can push a button and the app will suggest a
   random meal to the user
 - Optionally, before pushing the button, a user can specify if they
   want a cheaper or more expensive meal, or a faster or slower meal.
   The app then filters out inappropriate meals and makes a random
   selection from what remains.
